<b>Harman Correction</b>

<p>To correct a matrix using <b>Harman</b>, users should select <b>Harman</b> as a method under the sidepanel of the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab.</p>
<p>Users can <b>Quantile Normalize</b> the data before correction by selecting the <b>Quantile Normalize</b> checkbox.</p>
<p><b>Harman</b> is a PCA and constrained optimization based technique. It attempts to maximize the removal of the batch effect under the contraint that the potential for overcorrection is kept below the <b>Confidence Limit</b> parameter.
<p>The user can provide a <b>batch variable</b> for correction. By default, <b>BatchFLEX</b> will use the batch variable selected under the <b>"Select 1 - Data Input"</b> tab as the primary batch variable for correction. The user can also adjust the confidence limit, which is set to 0.95 and indicates that Harman requires 95% confidence that the detected effect is related to the <b>batch</b> variable before removal. Increasing the confidence limit will result in a more conservative correction while lowering the confidence limit will result in a more aggressive correction.</p>
<p><b>BatchFLEX</b> will automatically update either the <b>left (Method 1)</b> or <b>right (Method 2)</b> matrix whenever a method is changed.</p>

<p>Then, users can use the evaluation methods included in <b>BatchFLEX</b> to assess whether the <b>batch effect</b> is <b><u>removed</u></b> and to determine whether the <b>variable of interest</b> is <b><u>maintained</u></b> following <b>Harman correction</b>.</p>
