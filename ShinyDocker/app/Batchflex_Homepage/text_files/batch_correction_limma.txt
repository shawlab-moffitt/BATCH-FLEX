<b>Limma Correction</b>

<p>To correct a matrix using <b>Limma</b>, users should select <b>Limma</b> as a method under the sidepanel of the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab.</p>
<p>Users can <b>Quantile Normalize</b> the data before correction by selecting the <b>Quantile Normalize</b> checkbox.</p>
<p><b>Limma</b> fits a linear model to the data using information from the batch variable and the variable of interest and then removes the component that is due to the batch effect.
<p>The user can provide up to two different <b>batch variables</b> and any number of continuous numeric <b>covariates</b> for correction. If multiple <b>batch</b> arguments are used, the selected variables should be independent of each other. The effects are assumed to be additive. By default, <b>BatchFLEX</b> will use the batch variable selected under the <b>"Select 1 - Data Input"</b> tab as the primary batch variable for correction. This can be changed by selecting a different variable from the drop box under the sidepanel of the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting <b>Limma</b> as a correction method.</p>
<p><b>BatchFLEX</b> will automatically update either the <b>left (Method 1)</b> or <b>right (Method 2)</b> matrix whenever a method is changed.</p>

<p>Then, users can use the evaluation methods included in <b>BatchFLEX</b> to assess whether the <b>batch effect</b> is <b><u>removed</u></b> and to determine whether the <b>variable of interest</b> is <b><u>maintained</u></b> following <b>Limma correction</b>.</p>
