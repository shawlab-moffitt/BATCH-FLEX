<b>UMAP</b>
<p> Data can be visualized using <b>UMAP</b> which can found by first clicking the <b>PCA</b> tab under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and then clicking the <b>UMAP</b> tab.</p>
<p><b>UMAP</b> can be annotated by assigning <b>color</b> to any criteria in the meta file. From the <b>Select Feature Type</b> drop down box, ssers can also annotate the <b>UMAP</b> by gene expression by selecting <b>Matrix Features</b>, by PCA projection by selecting <b>PCA Projection</b>, by immune deconvolution by selecting <b>Immune Deconvolution Features</b>, or by gene sets by selecting <b>Gene Set Pathways</b>. Additionally, <b>UMAP</b> specific calculation parameters can be adjusted by the user as necessary. These parameters can be found under the <b>UMAP Parameters</b> section of the sidepanel after selecting the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and the <b>UMAP</b> tab. </p>
<p> Users can use <b>UMAP</b> to assess whether the samples are clustering according to the <b>batch variable</b> by assigning <b>color</b> to the <b>batch variable</b> or to the <b>variable of interest</b> by assigning <b>color</b> to the <b>variable of interest</b>. Clustering by <b>batch</b> indicates that a significant batch effect is driving the variability and should be corrected. Ideally, the data should cluster by the <b>variable of interest</b> with an intermixing of samples from different batches. </p>
