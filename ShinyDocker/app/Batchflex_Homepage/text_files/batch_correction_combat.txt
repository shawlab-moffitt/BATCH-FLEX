<b>ComBat Correction</b>

<p>To correct a matrix using <b>ComBat</b>, users should select <b>ComBat</b> as a method under the sidepanel of the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab.</p>
<p>Users can <b>Quantile Normalize</b> the data before correction by selecting the <b>Quantile Normalize</b> checkbox.</p>
<p><b>ComBat</b> uses empirical Bayes frameworks to remove batch effects. </p>
<p>The user can provide a <b>batch variable</b> for correction. By default, <b>BatchFLEX</b> will use the batch variable selected under the <b>"Select 1 - Data Input"</b> tab as the primary batch variable for correction. This can be changed by selecting a different variable from the drop box under the sidepanel of the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting <b>ComBat</b> as a correction method. <b>ComBat</b> also includes a parametric parameter, which is set to <b>TRUE</b> by default and allows <b>ComBat</b> to assume that the data is <i>parametric</i>. If the data is <i>non-parametric</i>, then users should uncheck this box. <b>ComBat</b> will make no prior assumptions and may take significantly longer to run, but will be more accurate. </p>
<p><b>BatchFLEX</b> will automatically update either the <b>left (Method 1)</b> or <b>right (Method 2)</b> matrix whenever a method is changed.</p>

<p>Then, users can use the evaluation methods included in <b>BatchFLEX</b> to assess whether the <b>batch effect</b> is <b><u>removed</u></b> and to determine whether the <b>variable of interest</b> is <b><u>maintained</u></b> following <b>ComBat correction</b>.</p>
