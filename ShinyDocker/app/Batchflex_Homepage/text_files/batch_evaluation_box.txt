<b>Boxplot</b>
<p>Users can access the <b>Boxplot</b> by clicking the <b>Boxplot</b> tab after clicking the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab.</p>
<p>The <b>Boxplot</b> can be subsetted or grouped to any variable in the meta file using the <b>Subset samples by</b> or the <b>Grouping Criteria</b> dropboxes. Additionally, any individual sample type within the grouping criteria can be selected or deselected if specific comparisons are desired using the <b>Select Groups</b> multiselect tool. <b>BatchFLEX</b> includes multiple different types of features for plotting such as individual genes, pca projections, immune deconvolution features, or gene set enrichment scores. These features can be adjusted using the <b>Select Feature Type</b> dropdown menu. Additionally, the <b>Boxplots</b> include multiple different statistical tests for comparisons using the <b>Stat Test Method</b> drop down menu. Finally, if desired, the <b>Boxplots</b> can be displayed as violin plots by selecting the <b>Violin Plot</b> radio button. These parameters can be found under the <b>Boxplot Parameters</b> section of the side panel under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting the <b>Boxplot</b>. </p>
<p>In addition to traditional data exploration, <b>Boxplots</b> can be used to assess whether a batch effect is present and whether it is removed after correction. To do this, users should group the samples by the <b>batch variable</b> and then use a feature that is expected to remain <b>stable</b> across the experiment like a housekeeping gene or a housekeeping geneset. A <b>batch effect</b> is <b>likely</b> if there is <b>unexpected variability</b> across different batches. Users can also assess the post correction <b>Boxplot</b> to determine if the batch effect is removed. </p>

<p>Users can also use the <b>Boxplots</b> to determine whether the batch correction results in overcorrection by first grouping the samples by the <b>variable of interest</b> and then selecting a variable that should be <b>altered</b> in the dataset based on the variable of interest. If the dataset <b>loses the ability</b> to </b>differentiate</b> between samples based on the variable of interest, then overcorrection is likely. </p>
<p>Overcorrection is important to monitor because it could prevent identification of interesting insights from the experiment in downstream analyses. <p>
