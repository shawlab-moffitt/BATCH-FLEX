<b>Principal Variance Component Analaysis</b>
<p>Users can access the <b>PVCA</b> plot by clicking the <b>PVCA</b> tab after clicking the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and the <b>Explanatory Variables</b> tab.</p>
<p>The <b>PVCA</b> plot can display any number of variables present in the meta file. By default, this is set to include 2 variables from the meta, but this can be adjusted by the user. <b>PVCA</b> also includes a percent Threshold parameter, which can be adjusted and sets the minimum amount of the variability that must be explained by the principal components to be included. These parameters can be found under the <b>Explanatory Variables Parameters</b> section of the side panel under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting the <b>Explanatory Variables</b> tab and the <b>PVCA</b> tab. </p>
<p>The <b>PVCA</b> plot displays the weighted average proportion variance that is explained by the user selected variables from the sample-level metadata. <b>PVCA</b> first uses PCA to reduce the data dimensions while maintaining the variability of the data and then uses variance component analysis to fit a mixed linear model using factors of interest as random effects to estimate and partition the total variability. </p>
<p>The <b>PVCA</b> plot displays the total variability extracted from the dataset partitioned by each variable included by the user. For all plots, the total variability is set at 1, making each partition easy to interpret. By default, <b>PVCA</b> includes an interaction variable denoted by <b>":"</b> in between each selected variable as well as a residual variable, which contains all variability not explained by the selected variables.  </p>
<p>A <b>Batch Effect</b> can be identified as a high weighted average proportion variance explained by the <b>Batch</b> variable. Users can assess how successful the chosen correction method is at removing the <b>Batch Effect</b> by the <b>reduction</b> of the weighted average proportion variance explained by the <b>Batch</b> variable. Users can also determine whether there is any overcorrection by assessing whether the weighted average proportion variance explained by the <b>variable of interest</b> is <b>reduced</b> following correction. An ideal correction method will <b>reduce</b> the weighted average proportion variance explained by the <b>batch</b> and <b>preserve</b> the weighted average proportion variance explained by the <b>variable of interest</b>.</p>
