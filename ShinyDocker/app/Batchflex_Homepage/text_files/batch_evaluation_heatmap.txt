<b>Heatmap</b>
<p>Users can access <b>BatchFLEX</b> generated <b>Heatmaps</b> by clicking the <b>Heatmaps</b> tab after clicking the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and the first <b>Cluster Plots</b> tab.</p>
<p>To help improve calculation speed, the <b>top 2000</b> most variable features by the <b>mean absolute deviation</b> are selected by default, however, the feature number and variance measure can be easily altered by the user. These parameters can be found under the <b>Cluster Parameters</b> section of the sidepanel under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting the <b>Heatmap</b> tab. </p>
<p>The <b>Heatmap</b> can be annotated by multiple features in the meta data and can be clustered using a variety of different methods. These parameters can be found under the <b>Heatmap Parameters</b> section of the sidepanel under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting the <b>Heatmap</b> tab. </p>
<p>Users can use the <b>Heatmap</b> to visually assess how the samples are clustering according to the top most variable genes to determine if a batch effect is present and if that effect is removed after correction. <p>
<p>Users can use these analyses to objectively determine whether correction improves the clustering of the data to better correlate with the variable of interest. The <b>Heatmap</b> in our example dataset shows that after <b>Limma</b> correction, the batch effect has less impact on sample clustering and the variable of interest has greater impact.</p>
