<p>BatchFLEX allows users with <b><u>no coding or batch correction experience</u></b> to easily upload a dataset, to detect if a batch effect is present using multiple evaluation techniques, to correct for any batch effects using the most widely known and well regarded correction methods and to determine if the batch correction is successful at <b><u>removing</u></b> the <b>batch effect</b> and <b><u>preserving</u></b> the <b>variable of interest</b>. Users can easily compare correction methods to ensure that the <b>most optimal</b> correction method is chosen for their data and for their specific use purpose. Finally, after the user is satisfied with the correction, they can easily export of all corrected and uncorrected matrices and any desired evaluation figures or tables into a single zip folder.</p>
<p>For any questions, please select the <b>"Need Tutorial?"</b> button, which will direct users to a thorough tutorial, which covers app navigation and provides helpful information for the correction and evaluation methods included in the app.</p>
<p>To assist in the inital selection of a batch correction method, please refer to the algorithm in the <b>BatchFLEX workflow</b> card.</p>
