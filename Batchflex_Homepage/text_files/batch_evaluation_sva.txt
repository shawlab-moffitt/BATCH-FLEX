<b>SVA</b>
<p> Data can be visualized using <b>SVA</b> which can found by first clicking the <b>SVA</b> tab under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and then clicking the <b>SVA Analysis</b> tab.</p>
<p>The <b>SVA</b> analysis plot can be annotated by assigning <b>color</b> to any criteria in the meta file. The user can also adjust SVA specific parameters such as the <b>number of variable</b> to include in the analysis as well as the method used to estimate the number of surrogate variables. By default, <b>leek</b> is selected, but this can easily be changed by using the <b>Method</b> dropbox. This method is used when clicking the <b>Calculate Number of Estiamted Surrogate Variables</b> button is clicked, which will allow <b>SVA</b> to calculate this to provide an objective measure of the estimated number of surrogate variables present in the data. Allowing <b>SVA</b> to estimate the surrogate variables can help the user identify if any additional factors are driving the variability that is not accounted for the by the batch variable or the variable of interest. By Default, <b>Two</b> variables are estimated for simplicity. These parameters can be found under the <b>SVA Parameters</b> section of the sidepanel after selecting the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and the <b>SVA Analysis</b> tab. </p>
<p><b>SVA</b> can be used to discover the batch effect as an estimated surrogate variable. If <b>SVA_1</b> or <b>SVA_2</b> is able to group the variables when coloring by <b>Batch</b>, then it is highly likely that the <b>Batch Effect</b> is present in that surrogate variable and is driving a significant amount of the variability in the dataset and should be corrected.</p>
