<b>Explanatory Variables</b>
<p>Users can access the <b>Explanatory Variables</b> plot by clicking the <b>Explanatory Variables Plot</b> tab after clicking the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab and the <b>Explanatory Variables</b> tab.</p>
<p>The <b>Explanatory Variables</b> plot can display up to 10 variables present in the meta file. 3 variables are included by default, however, this can be adjusted by the user. These parameters can be found under the <b>Explanatory Variables Parameters</b> section of the side panel under the <b>"Step 2 - Batch Correction"</b> tab after selecting the <b>Explanatory Variables</b> tab and the <b>Explanatory Variables Plot</b> tab. </p>
<p>The <b>Explanatory Variables</b> plot displays the percentage of variance for each gene that is explained by the variables in the sample-level metadata. A <b>Batch Effect</b> can be identified as a high percentage of variance explained by the <b>Batch</b> variable. Users can assess how successful the chosen correction method is at removing the <b>Batch Effect</b> by how much the percent variance explained by the <b>Batch</b> variable is <b>reduced</b>. Users can also determine whether there is any overcorrection by assessing whether the percent variance explained by the <b>variable of interest</b> is <b>reduced</b> following correction. An ideal correction method will <b>reduce</b> the percent variance explained by the <b>batch</b> and <b>preserve</b> the percent variance explained by the <b>variable of interest</b>.</p>
